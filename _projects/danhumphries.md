The junior Dan in the lab has an MSci in Neuroscience from UCL and an MA in Philosophy from KCL. In the final years of his Neuroscience MSci, he picked up skills in software engineering, data analysis, and EEG/MEG theory that led to a technical career and his current RA position in the lab. In his Philosophy MA, he picked up very little that is useful, but an awful lot that is interesting. Dan works freelance as a web/graphics engineer, occasionally moonlights as an artist, and is interested in using methods from logic, topology, and abstract algebra to study the representation of conceptual spaces in humans.
