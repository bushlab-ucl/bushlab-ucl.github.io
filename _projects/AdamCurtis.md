Adam completed his PhD in the [York Episodic Memory Lab](http://www.aidanhorner.org/) under the supervision of Professor Aidan Horner (University of York) and Professor Maria Wimber (University of Glasgow), where he used MEG and multivariate decoding to investigate predictive processing accounts of schema effects in episodic memory. Prior to this, he worked as a research technician in the [Sleep, Language and Memory (SLAM) lab](https://www.york.ac.uk/psychology/research/language-cognition-memory/slam/) at the University of York under the supervision of Professor Gareth Gaskell, where he investigated the contribution of episodic memory and sleep consolidation to language comprehension. Adam is now a post-doc in the Human Electrophysiology lab at UCL, where he will be using iEEG and MEG to study memory in humans.
