The UCL Human Electrophysiology lab investigates the mechanisms of human spatial and episodic memory function. Utilising intracranial EEG and single cell recordings from epilepsy patients (at the [National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery](https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/our-hospitals/national-hospital-neurology-and-neurosurgery)) and MEG recordings from healthy volunteers (at the [Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/)) alongside computational modelling, we aim to elucidate the cellular and network level mechanisms that support the various mnemonic functions ascribed to the hippocampus and surrounding medial temporal lobe

We are based in the [UCL Division of Biosciences](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/ucl-biosciences) - one of the worldâ€™s foremost centres for research and teaching in the biological sciences and one of the largest Divisions within UCL

We benefit from close collaborations with the research groups of [Neil Burgess](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icn/research/research-groups/space-memory) at the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, [Caswell Barry](https://barry-lab.com/) at the UCL Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, [Gareth Barnes](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/team/meg-team/) at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Neuroimaging, and [Matthew Walker](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ion/people/professor-matthew-walker) at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology

We are supported by an EPSRC Frontier Research Grant
